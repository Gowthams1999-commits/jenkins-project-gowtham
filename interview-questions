# 1. How to take backup of jenkins and it's related folders?

âœ… What You Should Back Up:
At a minimum, you should back up the JENKINS_HOME directory. This contains:

jobs/ â€” your job configurations

config.xml â€” Jenkins system configuration

credentials.xml â€” secure credentials

users/ â€” user configurations

secrets/ â€” encrypted credentials and keys

plugins/ â€” installed plugins

nodes/ â€” configured nodes

You can find your JENKINS_HOME path in:

Jenkins UI â†’ Manage Jenkins â†’ Configure System

Or it's defined in the environment variable or startup script

ðŸ’» How to Manually Backup Jenkins
Stop Jenkins (optional but safer):

# sudo systemctl stop jenkins
Copy the Jenkins Home:


# cp -r /var/lib/jenkins /path/to/your/backup/location
Restart Jenkins (if you stopped it):


# sudo systemctl start jenkins
ðŸ”„ Automating Backups with a Script
You can use a cron job and script like this:


#!/bin/bash

BACKUP_DIR="/path/to/jenkins-backups"
JENKINS_HOME="/var/lib/jenkins"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%F-%H-%M")
DEST="$BACKUP_DIR/jenkins-backup-$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz"

mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR
tar -czvf $DEST $JENKINS_HOME
Then add it to crontab:


crontab -e

0 2 * * * /path/to/your/backup_script.sh
(This runs every day at 2 AM)

ðŸ“¦ Jenkins Backup Plugins (Optional)
ThinBackup Plugin (GUI-based):

Install from Manage Jenkins â†’ Plugins

Configure in Manage Jenkins â†’ ThinBackup

Supports scheduled backups and restore
