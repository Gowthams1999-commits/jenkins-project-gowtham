# 1. How to take backup of jenkins and it's related folders?

✅ What You Should Back Up:
At a minimum, you should back up the JENKINS_HOME directory. This contains:

jobs/ — your job configurations

config.xml — Jenkins system configuration

credentials.xml — secure credentials

users/ — user configurations

secrets/ — encrypted credentials and keys

plugins/ — installed plugins

nodes/ — configured nodes

You can find your JENKINS_HOME path in:

Jenkins UI → Manage Jenkins → Configure System

Or it's defined in the environment variable or startup script

💻 How to Manually Backup Jenkins
Stop Jenkins (optional but safer):

# sudo systemctl stop jenkins
Copy the Jenkins Home:


# cp -r /var/lib/jenkins /path/to/your/backup/location
Restart Jenkins (if you stopped it):


# sudo systemctl start jenkins
🔄 Automating Backups with a Script
You can use a cron job and script like this:


#!/bin/bash

BACKUP_DIR="/path/to/jenkins-backups"
JENKINS_HOME="/var/lib/jenkins"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%F-%H-%M")
DEST="$BACKUP_DIR/jenkins-backup-$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz"

mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR
tar -czvf $DEST $JENKINS_HOME
Then add it to crontab:


crontab -e

0 2 * * * /path/to/your/backup_script.sh
(This runs every day at 2 AM)

📦 Jenkins Backup Plugins (Optional)
ThinBackup Plugin (GUI-based):

Install from Manage Jenkins → Plugins

Configure in Manage Jenkins → ThinBackup

Supports scheduled backups and restore

# 2. How to trigger jenkins pipeline/jobs?

✅ 1. Manual Trigger
Click "Build Now" on the Jenkins job dashboard.

Ideal for ad-hoc runs or testing jobs manually.

⏰ 2. Scheduled Trigger (Cron Syntax)
Configure under Build Triggers → Build periodically.

Uses Unix-style cron syntax:


H 2 * * *      # Every day at 2 AM (H = hash to spread load)
H/15 * * * *   # Every 15 minutes

🔄 3. SCM Polling (e.g., Git)
Build Triggers → Poll SCM.

Jenkins will poll the repo at intervals and trigger builds if changes are detected.

Example:


H/5 * * * *    # Poll every 5 minutes
